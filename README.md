# ObjectExtractor
Hastily and horribly written t3d parser that spits out a json and vmf containing all the static props in the level. This was built for a specific person, I will not be providing support for it, I am merely uploading this to keep it somewhere. This code is not clean in *any* capacity, but it works and I needed it finished the same day.
